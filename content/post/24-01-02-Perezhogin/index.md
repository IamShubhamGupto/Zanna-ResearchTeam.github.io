**Pavel Perezhogin** is lead author of this new MÂ²LInES [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02517), describing the implementation, in the GFDL MOM6 ocean model, of a data-driven equation-discovery parameterization of mesoscale eddies. This scale-aware parametrization improved biases in the mean flow and energetics for a range of resolutions and in different ocean configurations. The work was done in collaboration with **Cheng Zhang**, **Alistair Adcroft**, **Carlos Fernandez-Granda** and **Laure Zanna**.
