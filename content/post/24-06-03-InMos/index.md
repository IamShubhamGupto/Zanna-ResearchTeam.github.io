Schmidt Sciences [announced](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/five-projects-will-receive-funding-to-advance-understanding-of-ocean-systems-in-a-changing-climate/) that five global science and technology projects have been selected to join the [Ocean Biogeochemistry Virtual Institute (OBVI)](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/the-ocean-biogeochemistry-virtual-institute-obvi/) addressing gaps in ocean data and modeling efforts. 
Among them, InMOS or Integration of models and observations across scales, led by Tim DeVries (UCSB) and Ralph Keeling (Scripps). Laure Zanna is a PI in this project. 

InMOS will use AI and machine learning to build a framework for integrating both oceanic and atmospheric data across a wide range of space and time scales to improve our ability to quantify warming, deoxygenation, and acidification of the global ocean. 
This project will rely heavily on [MÂ²LInES](https://m2lines.github.io/) work, another Schmidt Sciences project led by Laure Zanna.
